## üìä Featured Projects

### 1. üõí E-Commerce Cart Abandonment Analysis & Executive Dashboard

**Business Problem:**  
An e-commerce company needed to understand why 70% of customers were abandoning their shopping carts before checkout.

**My Approach:**
- Cleaned and analyzed over 5,000 customer session records using **SQL** to identify patterns

- Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** tracking abandonment metrics by customer segment and product category  
- Compared effectiveness of discount coupons vs. loyalty programs using cohort analysis  

**Tools Used:** PostgreSQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib), Tableau  

**Key Insights:**
- High shipping costs ($20+) drove **$75K in lost revenue**, 36% of all abandonment  
- Mobile users abandoned at 1.5√ó the rate of desktop users  
- Customers who abandoned once had a 45% probability of completing a purchase after an email follow-up  

**Business Impact:**  
Quantified **$209K revenue recovery opportunity** and recommended prioritizing loyalty programs over generic discounts based on customer lifetime value analysis.
